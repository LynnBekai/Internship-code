The file names normalized_counts.rmd is the R code done to normalized the RNA-seq data used to constraint the model
The unknown file is a practice file done to get used to the package
The Fluxes file is the study done on the model using the normalized constraints ang etting the genes affected in the model using these constraint conditions
